## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap


### What I learned

CSS flex Property & Grid template areas finally open my eye toward it.
Also bootstrap helps a lot in making design responsive.


### Continued development

I need to complete more challenges in future.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - Grid template areas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Grid_Template_Areas) - This helped me for using grid . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS flex Property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_flex.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flex properties. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
